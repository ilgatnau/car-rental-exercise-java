/**
 * Story 5 - car maintenance

As a car renter i need to be able to make a car unavailable for rental for a specific period...
...So that I can make repairs to a car or get it serviced
acceptance criteria: the car being out of service needs to be booked like a car rental (but see below)
acceptance criteria: if the car to be booked already has an existing booking then I should be able to move
the booking to a new car of the same alpha car rental group (if any exists) - for example a group &quot;A&quot; car
acceptance criteria: i should be able to differentiate between a rental and service booking
design criteria: during any booking movement we need to avoid another renters being able to book the
car that the booking is moving to
